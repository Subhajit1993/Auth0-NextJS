This project was bootstrapped with [Create Next App](https://github.com/segmentio/create-next-app).

## Folder Structure

After creating an app, it should look something like:

```
.
├── README.md
├── components
│   ├── head.js
│   └── nav.js
├── next.config.js
├── node_modules
│   ├── [...]
├── package.json
├── pages
│   └── index.js
├── static
│   └── favicon.ico
└── yarn.lock
```

Routing in Next.js is based on the file system, so `./pages/index.js` maps to the `/` route and
`./pages/about.js` would map to `/about`.

The `./static` directory maps to `/static` in the `next` server, so you can put all your
other static resources like images or compiled CSS in there.

Out of the box, we get:

- Automatic transpilation and bundling (with webpack and babel)
- Hot code reloading
- Server rendering and indexing of `./pages`
- Static file serving. `./static/` is mapped to `/static/`

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `.next` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

### `npm run start`
